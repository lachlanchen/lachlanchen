# Hey there, I'm Lachlan Chen üëã

I'm a creator, researcher, and entrepreneur living at the crossroads of technology and art. By day, I'm knee-deep in imaging systems research. By night, I build platforms and tools that empower creators and make sophisticated technology more accessible to everyone.

## üé® Creative Platforms

### [lazying.art](https://lazying.art)
My flagship project celebrating the forgotten art of intentional rest. In our hyperproductive world, I'm building a community that recognizes the creative power of taking a step back. This isn't about doing nothing‚Äîit's about creating space for what truly matters.

### [onlyideas.art](https://onlyideas.art)
A sanctuary where ideas can flourish from conception to reality. I believe that every creative spark deserves protection and nurturing. This platform helps creators safeguard their concepts while providing tools to develop them into tangible projects.

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Creative Tools

I'm developing a suite of "Auto" tools to democratize creative production:

- **AutoCaption** - Intelligent image captioning for accessibility and discovery
- **AutoTranscription** - Turning spoken word into searchable, editable text
- **AutoTranslation** - Breaking language barriers for global creative exchange
- **AutoPublication** - Streamlining the journey from draft to published work
- **WordsCards** - Interactive vocabulary building for writers and language learners
- **WordsOrigins** - Exploring the etymology and evolution of language
- **AutoLanguage** - NLP tools for style analysis and linguistic enhancement
- **AutoReading** - Making complex texts more accessible through AI summarization
- **AutoResearch** - Accelerating research workflows for scholars and creators
- **AutoMusic** - Bridging the gap between musical inspiration and production

## üî¨ Lazeal OptiX

Leading an initiative to democratize cancer diagnostics through lensless imaging technology. We're working to bring advanced diagnostic capabilities into homes, making early detection more accessible and less intimidating.

## üìù About Me

Currently pursuing my PhD in Imaging Systems at The University of Hong Kong, with previous degrees from Tsinghua (MSc, Precision Medicine) and Sichuan University (BSc, Applied Chemistry).

I find that moving between technical precision and creative flow keeps both sides of my brain happy.
