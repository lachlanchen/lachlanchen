👋 Hi, I’m Rongzhou CHEN (@lachlanchen on GitHub)

👀 I’m interested in advancing healthcare through technology. My passion lies in cell imaging, detection, segmentation, and profiling, and harnessing these for early cancer detection and diagnosis.

🌱 I’m currently deeply involved in a project called Lazeal OptiX. This project aims to democratize advanced diagnostics through lensless imaging, bringing the power of sophisticated diagnostics into the comfort of homes. We embrace the 'Art of Lazying' - simplifying complex diagnostics processes to their most user-friendly forms.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other passionate individuals and organizations who are interested in improving healthcare accessibility. Whether it's new diagnostic technologies, machine learning algorithms for healthcare, or innovative healthcare solutions, I'm all ears.

📫 How to reach me: You can get in touch with me on LinkedIn or send an Email.

Keep healthy and embrace the art of lazying! 🚀
