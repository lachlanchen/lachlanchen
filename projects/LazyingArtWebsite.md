Local path: /home/lachlan/Projects/LazyingArt/

Purpose
- Public website for LazyingArt: the community and philosophy around strategic rest and friction‑removing tools.

Notes
- Static site contents (assets, pages) organized for simple hosting; pairs with the `the-art-of-lazying` umbrella repo for code and demos.
