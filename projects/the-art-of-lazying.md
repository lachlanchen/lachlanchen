# The Art of Lazying

Local path: /home/lachlan/Projects/the-art-of-lazying/

Problem
- Modern workflows optimize for busyness, not meaning; creators and learners drown in overhead.

Solution
- An umbrella of agents, automation, and learning tools (and a book) that reduce needless work and cultivate “strategic rest,” channeling energy to what matters.

Impact
- Practical systems (subtitles, captions, publication) and cultural framing (LazyingArt) that help people ship more with less stress.

## Themes
- Community and experiments in strategic rest (LazyingArt)
- Agents and automation that remove friction
- Language learning tools (E‑ink displays, word cards, subtitles)
- Vlogs and notes capturing real‑world practice

## Notable Projects
- EinkWordsGPT — e‑ink + GPT for passive word learning
- WordsOrigin — etymology graphs and analysis
- VideoCaptionerWithClip / VideoCaptionerWithVit — automatic captions for images/videos
- MultilingualWhisper — fine‑grained multilingual subtitles
- LazyEdit — automatic video editing pipeline
- AutoPublication / AutoPubMonitor — content pipeline + publishing
