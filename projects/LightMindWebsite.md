# LightMindWebsite


Problem
- Communicating LightMind’s mission (privacy‑first memory enhancement) requires a clear, performant, and visually engaging web presence.

Solution
- A static site (CNAME `lightmind.art`) with strong visuals and a concise narrative of the device, technology, impact, and contact. Built as a lightweight, fast landing page.

Impact
- Establishes brand and investor/partner credibility while remaining easy to host and iterate.

Notes
- `index.html` contains a single‑page layout; `_config.yml`/CNAME for deployment. Contact: `contact@lightmind.art`.
