# AI‑Wearable (Omi)

Local path: /home/lachlan/Projects/omi/

Problem
- Capturing and recalling key information from daily conversations remains manual; people miss details and action items.

Solution (upstream)
- Open‑source wearable (“Omi”) that records, transcribes, summarizes, and proposes actions; mobile app and cloud services for sync and control.

Impact
- Improves recall and follow‑through; a strong reference for LightMind’s direction on privacy‑first memory augmentation.

Highlights
- On‑device capture and transcription
- Summaries and action items
- Mobile app + cloud APIs
