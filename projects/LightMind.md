# LightMind


Problem
- People routinely miss, forget, or mis‑prioritize vital details from daily conversations; existing “recall tech” often trades privacy for convenience.

Solution
- An AI‑powered, privacy‑first memory enhancement wearable. LightMind combines neuromorphic optical encryption with multimodal AI to transform everyday moments into a searchable, personal memory graph.

## Overview
- Privacy by design: facial features are irreversibly encoded; raw images are not stored
- Multimodal capture: vision + audio → summaries, entities, events, relationships
- Memory graph: people, places, timelines; natural‑language search
- Local‑first with optional encrypted sync

## Key Innovations
- Neuromorphic Optical Encryption — enables recognition without storing reconstructable faces
- Ultra‑low‑power capture and compression for all‑day wear
- On‑device/edge inference + cloud assist when needed

## Core Features
- Real‑time capture with power‑aware compression
- AI summaries, reminders, and cross‑day linking
- Personal knowledge graph with temporal and social context
- Private by default; export and deletion controls

## Technology (indicative)
- Hardware: micro‑camera, MEMS mics, ARM Cortex‑class with NPU, BLE/Wi‑Fi
- Software: edge pipelines for CV/ASR/NLP; encrypted data pipeline; mobile apps
- Models: scene understanding, diarization + speech, NLP, knowledge graph reasoning
